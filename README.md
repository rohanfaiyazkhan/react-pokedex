# Pokedex App

Retro-inspired pokedex app. I know, there are a lot of Pokemon apps out there. How does this one differ? It looks like an actual Pokedex!

I built this for my portfolio to showcase a few things:

1. A small React project to showcase how I approach organizing React code
2. A small showcase of UI design with a particular theme (retro Pokemon inspired style) in mind
3. Pure CSS based animations
4. A custom approach to network requests, caching and synchronizing. Not the most optimal solution, but a showcase of what I can do on a limited schedule and scope.
5. How I approach synchronizing state during network requests
6. Native Text to Speech implementation

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm convert-svg`

Uses `react-svgr` to convert any SVG files in `src/assets/raw` to corresponding React component in `src/assets/component`.
